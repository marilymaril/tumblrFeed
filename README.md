# Lab 1 - **Tumblr Feed**

**Tumblr Feed** is a photo browsing app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [X] User can scroll through a feed of images returned from the Tumblr API (5pts)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [X] Added Pull to Refresh  (+1-3pts)
- [X] Added a second ViewController that fetched displayed the caption and photo of the selected post

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to see how my peers implemented the sizing of the table cells since it wasn't explicitly stated in the lab
2. I would also like to discuss what other features would be good to add to the app

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

During the creation of this app, I found it very difficult to figure out how to change the table cell size. I really wanted them to be square and to have the image cropped in order to extend past the boundaries of the cell width, but I wasn't able to figure out how to.
